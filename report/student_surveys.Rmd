## Data exploration

### What is the dataset like? 

```{r Smell test data, echo=FALSE}
str(dt)
```

There are `r ncol(dt)` columns and `r nrow(dt)` rows in the dataset. 

### How many users completed the survey?

```{r Number of users, echo=FALSE}
setnames(dt, names(dt), c("section", "q", "q_type", "q_title", "q_text", "bonus", "difficulty", "answer", "answer_match", "responses"))

# remove trailing space and some symbols
dt[, answer := gsub("Â.|â€™", "", answer)]

dt[section %like% "User", unique(section)]
```

There are `r length(dt[section %like% "User", unique(section)])` users in the dataset. 

### Q1: Is this your first post-secondary degree?

```{r PSD, echo=FALSE}
dt[q_text == "Is this your first time attending a post-secondary institute (college, university, technical institute etc.)?" & responses == 1, .(section, answer)]

psd <- dt[q_text == "Is this your first time attending a post-secondary institute (college, university, technical institute etc.)?" & responses == 1, .(section, answer)]

# plot bar graph
ggplot(psd, aes(x=answer, fill=answer)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="count", fill="#0072B2", colour="black") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size=14), 
        axis.title = element_text(face="bold", size=18), 
        legend.position = "none", title = element_text(size=18)) +
  xlab("") + 
  ylab("Number of students") +
  ggtitle("Is this your first time attending a post-secondary institute?") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 8, 1))
```

```{r Save plot q1, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ggsave("../figures/q1.png", width = 9, height = 8)
```

### Q2: Which term did you start the CIT program?

```{r Term data, echo=FALSE}
dt[q_text == "Which term did you start the CIT program?" & responses == 1, answer]

term <- dt[q_text == "Which term did you start the CIT program?" & responses == 1, .(section, answer)]

# plot bar graph
ggplot(term, aes(x=answer, fill=answer)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="count", fill="#0072B2", colour="black") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size=14), 
        axis.title = element_text(face="bold", size=18), 
        legend.position = "none", title = element_text(size=18)) +
  xlab("") + 
  ylab("Number of students") +
  ggtitle("Which term did you start the CIT program?")
```

```{r Save plot q2, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ggsave("../figures/q2.png", width = 9, height = 8)
```

### Q3: What do you think is the purpose of the online orientation?

```{r Purpose}
dt[q_text == "What do you think is the purpose of the online orientation?", answer, by = section]
```

### Q4: Please indicate if you use the online orientation to find information about the following topics. 

```{r Online orientation for information, fig.height= 10, fig.width=11, echo=FALSE}
info <- dt[q_text == "Please indicate if you use the online orientation to find information about the following topics:" & responses == 1]
info[, answer_match := factor(answer_match, levels = c("Strongly Agree", "Agree", "Neutral", "Disagree", "Strongly Disagree"))]

# plot bar graph
ggplot(info, aes(x=answer_match)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="count", fill="#0072B2", colour="black") +
  facet_wrap(~ answer, ncol = 3) + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1), 
        axis.text = element_text(size=14), 
        axis.title = element_text(face="bold", size=18),
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14)) +
  xlab("") + 
  ylab("Number of students")
```

```{r Save plot q4, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ggsave("../figures/q4.png", width = 11, height = 10)
```

### Q5: Please answer the following questions to help us assess which topics need improvement (knowledge/object assessment).

# plot bar graph
